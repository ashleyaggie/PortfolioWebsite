                <span class="container">
                <p>I am a graduate from Texas A&M University with a bachelor's in English. I have a high attention to detail and a drive to improve both myself and my products.
                <br><br>
                I have always been a creative with an interest in both the artistic side of things as well as the technical. I have a unique perspective to find the things about a website to attract attention.
                <br><br>
                I want to help clients with designing websites that fulfill the need to impress while also being easy to use and understandable. After all, a website isn't going to do much good if the user can't figure out how it works!</p>
